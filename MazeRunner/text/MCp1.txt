In Monte Carlo we do play the game.
And after each succesful run,
the game updates.
We are going to see 9 runs
and watch how the policy updates
For small board it is run
1, 13 ,25 ,37, 50,62,75,87 and 100
because I did 100 runs to train
the game.

For medium (were I did 1000 runs)
it is run 1, 130,250, 370, 500, 620
